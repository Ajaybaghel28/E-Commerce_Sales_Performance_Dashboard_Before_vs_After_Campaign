E-Commerce Sales Performance Dashboard: Before vs. After Campaign
Project Overview
This dashboard project analyzes the impact of a marketing campaign on e-commerce sales performance, comparing data before, during, and after the campaign. It provides insights into regional sales growth, product category performance, customer demographics, and return on investment (ROI) across different regions.

Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:

To evaluate sales growth by region and product category before, during, and after the marketing campaign.
To understand customer demographics (age and gender) across regions for campaign-period purchases.
To assess the ROI of the marketing campaign by region.
To present the overall impact of the marketing campaign on total sales.
Data Sources
This analysis was conducted using three primary data sources:

Sales Transactions: Contains information on sales transactions before, during, and after the campaign.
Marketing Campaign Data: Provides campaign budgets and other marketing metrics.
Customer Data: Demographic information including age, gender, and region.
Dashboard Components
1. Filters
Campaign Period: Allows users to filter the dashboard to view data for "Before," "During," or "After" the marketing campaign periods.
Gender: Filter to separate data by gender (Male, Female).
Region: Filter to focus on specific regions (East, North, South, West).
2. Visualizations

Product Category Performance: Home Appliances and Electronics categories experienced the largest sales increases, indicating a successful campaign impact on these segments.
Demographic Reach: The campaign was effective across age groups, with notable engagement from the 25-34 and 35-44 age segments.
